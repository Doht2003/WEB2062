//first class
//1.first class functions this means that functions are treated as values they are another type of object
 
//2.we can sotre functions in variables or properties
//passing functions as argumetns to OTHER functions an example can be is a event listener
 
//3.they can return functions FROM other functions
 
//4.call methods on fuctions bind method
 
//higher order
//1. A function that receives another function as an argumrnt that returns a new function or both this is only possible because of first class functions
 
//a event listener is a higher order function becasue it receives a call back function its called a call back function because it will be called later by the higher order function
